## Premise:
### This app's ambition is to ultimately be built out to record stats for various sports.  If one has a weekly soccer game or is coaching a little league football team, this web app will provide the means to track team and player stats from game to game across a season. 

### To begin with, we've built the first leg around Roller Derby.  Our own [Abby Johnson](http://www.arizonaderbydames.com/abby-arsenic) is a leader in the local [Arizona Derby Dames league](http://www.arizonaderbydames.com/).  To learn a little about how a roller derby match is carried out, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpo6M5iynI) ([or this one for the tl;dr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg6nlCnD-GE)).

## Tech used
### This app is built in JavaScript both in the front and back.  Here is a pretty comprehensive list of what is being included in our app:
### 1. Node.js
### 2. Express
### 3. Sequelize (using MySQL dialect)
### 4. Handlebars
### 5. jQuery
### 6. Parallax
### 7. Particle.js
### 8. Various NPM packages include:
